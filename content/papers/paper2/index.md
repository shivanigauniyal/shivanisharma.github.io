# abstract: |
#     SuperdropNet is a neural-network emulator of warm-rain cloud microphysics that learns bulk-moment updates directly from superdroplet simulations. The model is trained with multi-step autoregressive rollouts, enforces physical constraints (mass conservation, irreversibility, positivity), and uses carefully curated training data to limit stochastic artifacts. Across a wide range of initial conditions, SuperdropNet delivers stable long-horizon predictions, narrows or surpasses the accuracy of classical two-moment bulk schemes for many cases, and substantially outperforms prior ML-based parameterizations on timing and magnitude of cloud-to-rain transitions.
