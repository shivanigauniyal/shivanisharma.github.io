  "Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used in Earth system models (ESMs) to emulate sub-grid-scale processes. This paper presents the coupling of SuperdropNet, a machine learning model for emulating warm-rain processes in cloud microphysics, with the ICON (Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic) model v2.6.5. SuperdropNet replaces the collisionâ€“coalescence process in the two-moment cloud microphysics scheme. The paper discusses three coupling strategies: embedded Python, pipes, and Yet Another Coupler (YAC). Validation in the warm-bubble scenario demonstrates stability and physical consistency of SuperdropNet, with embedded Python providing the best computational performance."
